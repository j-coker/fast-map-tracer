**Fast Map Tracer**

Performant line tracing algorithm applied to image data composed of an arbitrary number of RGB value IDs in a bitmap-based map. Implemented in Unity, C#.

Based loosely on the paper "Fast Contour-Tracing Algorithm Based on a Pixel-Following Method for Image Sensors" by Seo et al.
